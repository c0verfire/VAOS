# Known Compatibility Issues

* Charter Flights, due to the nature of VAOS's multi-airline capibilities, is unavailable. Use the Free Flight system in VAOS instead to regain the same functionality.
* The registration for aircraft within the schedule search is technically placeholder. Since VAOS runs a dynamic aircraft assignment system, you will get the required aircraft type, however the actual aircraft may be different.
